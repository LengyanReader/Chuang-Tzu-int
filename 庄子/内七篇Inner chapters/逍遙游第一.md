北海有一条鱼，名字叫鲲。鲲的体型庞大，不知有几千里。他变化为鸟，名字叫鹏。鹏的背部宽阔，不知有几千里。他奋起高飞时，双翅张开有如天边的云朵。这只巨鸟，在海风大作时，就会迁徙到南海去。南海，是一个天然大池	

In the North Sea there is a kind of fish by the name of kun, whose size covers thousands of li. The fish metamorphoses into a kind of bird by the name of peng, whose back covers thousands of li. When it rises in flight, its wings are like clouds that hang from the sky. When the wind blows over the sea, the peng moves to the South Sea, The Celestial Pond.

《齐谐》，是一本记载怪异事件的书。这本书上说：当大鹏要往南海迁徙时，水面激起三千里波涛，他拍/振翅盘旋而上，飞到九万里的高空。他是乘着六月刮起的大风而离开的。”野马似的空中游气，四处飞扬的尘埃，都是活动的生物被大风吹拂所造成的。天色苍苍，那是天空真正的颜色吗？还是因为遥远得看不到尽头的结果？从天空往下看，也不过是像这样的情况吧！”

According to Qi Xie, a collection of mysterious stories,"On its journey to the South Sea, the peng flaps (water)sprays for 3000 li and soars to a height of 90,000 li at the windy time of June." The air, the dusts and the microbes float in the sky at(being caused by) the breath of the wind.  Does the sky display the blueness as its true colour? Or does it reach an unattainable distance? When the looking from above, it must have observed a similar sight?!
